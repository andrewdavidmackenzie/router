This repo contains multiple implementations in different programming languages of a very simple algorithm to find the shortest route through a simple network of roads.

The problem is taken from a book on Haskell while I was learning some basic Haskell.

Since then I have added other language implementations (C, go, ruby, rust, lua) just to learn the basics of some of those languages and to complete the list with languages I'd already used.

It provides a very simple benchmark of their performance solving the problem, but the problem is very limited and I've only supplied one simple data set to test it on - it's not a serious attempt to benchmark those languages.

It might be useful to see the basic structure and language basics and travis CI for those languages for a newbie.
